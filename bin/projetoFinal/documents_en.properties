mr2Titulo=Maintenance and Repairs - General Guidelines for WEG Industrial Equipment
mr2Conteudo=Version 1.0 | Issued: 03/15/2025\nThe maintenance of industrial equipment is essential to ensure the safety, performance, and longevity of WEG products. This document outlines the core principles and precautions that must be followed by technicians and operators when performing preventive maintenance, corrective actions, and minor repairs on electrical, mechanical, and automated equipment.\nAll interventions must be planned in advance, following proper shutdown and safety procedures, in accordance with internal company policies and applicable regulations such as NR10 and NR12. Before starting any repair, the equipment must be completely disconnected from the power supply, with lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures applied and power absence confirmed.\nPreventive maintenance must follow the schedule defined in each equipment's technical manual. This includes, among other tasks, checking the tightness of electrical and mechanical connections, cleaning internal and external components, lubricating moving parts, inspecting cables and connectors, and measuring electrical and mechanical parameters. This type of maintenance is designed to anticipate failures, reduce unplanned downtimes, and ensure continuous system operation.\nCorrective maintenance must be performed whenever a malfunction is detected, such as overheating, unusual noises, excessive vibration, performance loss, structural cracks, or faulty sensors and controls. In such cases, the responsible technician must record the occurrence, assess the root cause of the issue, and perform the repair or replace parts according to the manufacturer's instructions. Replaced components must be identified and stored for analysis when applicable.\nUnder no circumstances should materials or tools that are incompatible with the equipment's technical specifications be used. The use of tampered components—such as makeshift wiring, improper insulation, or non-original parts—compromises machine safety and may void the warranty.\nAfter completing the service, the equipment must be tested under controlled conditions, with recorded parameters, and released for operation only after full validation. All maintenance and repair records must be logged in the company’s system in accordance with its technical traceability policy.

td2Titulo=Testing and Diagnostics - Procedures for Technical Verification of WEG Equipment
td2Conteudo=Version 1.0 | Issued: 03/15/2025 The execution of testing and diagnostics is essential to ensure the performance, safety, and reliability of WEG industrial equipment. These procedures must be carried out systematically, both during preventive maintenance and when investigating failures. Before any test, it is necessary to ensure that the equipment is in a safe condition, following release and energization protocols as required by technical standards. The environment must be controlled, with the work area isolated and the mandatory use of PPE. The tests vary depending on the type of equipment and may include electrical measurements (voltage, current, insulation resistance), vibration analysis, temperature checks using thermography, functional testing of sensors, relays, and inverters, as well as load simulation under partial or full conditions. For electronic equipment such as control panels, integrated diagnostic software may be used. All analysis must be performed with calibrated instruments by qualified professionals. The data obtained should be recorded in standardized technical reports, enabling comparison with the reference parameters defined by the manufacturer. Any anomalies identified must be promptly reported to the maintenance or engineering team for evaluation. After the diagnostic process, if intervention is required, the equipment may only be released after faults are corrected and its operation has been fully revalidated. This process ensures traceability, reduces unexpected downtime, and preserves the system’s operational integrity.
